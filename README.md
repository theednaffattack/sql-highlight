## This a fork of [SQL syntax highlight](https://github.com/scriptcoded/sql-highlight)!

This is a fork made with Typescript for use in a local project. I'll add tests and see if the
original package owner wants to use them at a later date.

## What's it all about?

SQL Highlight is a small package that highlights SQL queries. It can output to
both the terminal with Unicode escape sequences, as well as to normal HTML. Oh,
and there are no external dependencies üòâ

## Installation

Install via Yarn:

```bash
yarn add sql-highlight
```

Install via NPM:

```bash
npm install sql-highlight
```

## Usage

> Note that we're using ES6 import statements here. Usage with `require` works
> just as well.

**In its most basic form:**

```js
import { highlight } from "sql-highlight";

const sqlString =
  "SELECT `id`, `username` FROM `users` WHERE `email` = 'test@example.com'";

const highlighted = highlight(sqlString);

console.log(highlighted);
```

**Output:**

**HTML mode:**

```js
import { highlight } from "sql-highlight";

const sqlString =
  "SELECT `id`, `username` FROM `users` WHERE `email` = 'test@example.com'";

const highlighted = highlight(sqlString, {
  html: true,
});

document.body.innerHTML += highlighted;
```

**Output:**

```html
<span class="sql-hl-keyword">SELECT</span>
<span class="sql-hl-string">`id`</span>
<span class="sql-hl-special">,</span>
<span class="sql-hl-string">`username`</span>
<span class="sql-hl-keyword">FROM</span>
<span class="sql-hl-string">`users`</span>
<span class="sql-hl-keyword">WHERE</span>
<span class="sql-hl-string">`email`</span>
<span class="sql-hl-special">=</span>
<span class="sql-hl-string">'test@example.com'</span>
```

## Options

The following options may be passed to the `highlight` function.

| Option      | Value     | Default       | Description                                                                    |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| html        | `boolean` | `false`       | Set to true to render HTML instead of Unicode.                                 |
| classPrefix | `string`  | `'sql-hl-'`   | Prefix to prepend to classes for HTML span-tags. Is appended with entity name. |

\* `colors` option default value

## Disclaimer

This was initially a fork from https://github.com/pomahtuk/sequilize-highlight.
The repo wasn't being updated, NPM wasn't serving the latest version and there
was a severe memory leak. Though the latest version now exists on NPM, issues
still persist. This repo serves to address those problems, as well as providing
a cleaner interface that's not bound to Sequelize.

With version 3.0.0 the library was almost completely rewritten, which leaves
very little similarity with the original repo.
